# Replicant2Blender

## CURRENTLY IN ALPHA:
* Armature/Bones imports aren't perfect (only seems to work on certain models at the moment).
* No automatic texture setup.
* Please let me know of any issues (contact me here or on the [NieR:Modding Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7F76ZVv)).

## What does support right now?
* Character meshes.
* Weapon meshes.
* World/Map meshes.
* Honestly, any mesh pack I could find. (Let me know if you find one that doesn't work!)
* Multiple UV maps.
* Vertex groups.
* Basic armature.
* Materials.
